# Bookstore Coding Test

For this coding test I have created an online bookstore. The front-end is built with React and for the back-end I used Node and Mongodb Atlas. 

## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the back end folder and enter the environment variables to access the mongodb atlas database

## Front-End

To run the front-end cd into the bookstore folder and run "npm start". The site will be displayed on localhost:3000. 

## Back-End 

To start the back-end server cd into the back-end folder. As the site uses nodemon you can start the server by running "npm start" on the back-end as well.
